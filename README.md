# Equation-root-finder
 This is an equation root finding interface and includes 3rd degree equations.


# Information for the project 
>#### The reason I don't convert this and similar projects to exe is so you can read my code.
- ### 1- First we need to install `python` .

- ### 2- We need to download the necessary libraries. You can do this by typing the following commands in the terminal.
  - #### `pip install PyQt5`

- ### 3- We open the `Kokbulucu.py` file with python then run file.

- ### 4- After running, the interface will appear. On the left, you will see the sections where you need to write the coefficients of a quadratic equation. We have the calculate and clear buttons just below. To explain what it does, when you press the calculate button, our roots appear in the Result: section. When we press the Clear button, the Result: section is cleared. 

- ### 5- Same for the 3rd degree equation on the right. Differently, in third degree equations, there is also an imaginary activation part that allows you to see the irrational part of the roots if you wish.

- ### 6- We also have a language option in the upper right corner.

- ### 8- If you have any problems, you can send me a message.

- ### 9- Thanks for your time.
